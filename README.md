<small>### 🎯 Summary</small>  
<small>Small educational TCP port scanner (demo-only). Demonstrates socket programming, input validation, and safe-by-default design. Public demo restricted to 127.0.0.1.</small>

---

<small>### 🧠 Project Overview</small>  
<small>This public repository intentionally contains only demo assets and documentation so reviewers can understand the project safely. The full implementation is available on request (private branch/repo for interviews).</small>

---

<small>### 🔧 What I Built</small>  
<small>
• Interactive TCP port scanner that probes ports and reports open services  
• Input validation for IPv4 addresses and port ranges  
• UTF-8 safe logging and colorized terminal messages  
• Demo-mode design restricted to 127.0.0.1 for safe public demonstration  
• Professional documentation suitable for a security portfolio
</small>

---

<small>### 💡 What I Learned</small>  
<small>
• TCP socket fundamentals (connect probes, timeouts, network exceptions)  
• Defensive CLI programming and input validation  
• Safe output handling and UTF-8 logging  
• Ethical design for responsible security testing  
• How to communicate and document security projects for recruiters  
• Scan performance vs. detection tradeoffs  
• Cross-team awareness of safe testing practices
</small>

---

<small>### ⚙️ Future Enhancements</small>  
<small>
• Structured JSON/CSV output for SIEM or CMDB ingestion  
• RBAC and audit logging for governed scanning  
• Service banner fingerprinting (authorized only)  
• Automatic correlation with CVE databases  
• Auto-ticket generation and compliance dashboard
</small>

<small>### 👩‍💼 How I’d Operationalize This Project</small>  
<small>This tool forms the foundation for several operational and compliance improvements.</small>

<small>

| <small>Security Objective</small> | <small>How I’d Apply It</small> |
|:--|:--|
| <small>Asset Discovery & CMDB Accuracy</small> | <small>Schedule internal scans to verify reachable ports and cross-check asset records.</small> |
| <small>Vulnerability Management</small> | <small>Map discovered ports to services and CVEs for prioritized patching.</small> |
| <small>Detection & Monitoring</small> | <small>Use authorized scan patterns to tune IDS/IPS and reduce false positives.</small> |
| <small>Incident Response</small> | <small>Include scanner checks in triage playbooks for rapid exposure assessment.</small> |
| <small>Secure DevOps</small> | <small>Add lightweight scan steps in staging to detect unexpected service exposure.</small> |
| <small>ISO 27001/NIS2 Evidence</small> | <small>Treat scanner logs as auditable artifacts for A.8 (Asset Mgmt) and A.12 (Ops Security).</small> |
| <small>Awareness & Training</small> | <small>Use the demo to educate Dev/IT teams on exposure risk and remediation.</small> |

<small>### 🔗 Related GRC Project — My Extended Work</small>  
<small>
**GRC Config Auditor — Configuration Drift & Shadow IT Auditor**  
This project extends my original scanner framework into a GRC automation tool that reconciles CMDB baselines with network reality. It detects configuration drift, ghost assets, and shadow IT, and produces audit-ready evidence mapped to ISO 27001 and NIS2 controls.  
Together, both projects form a continuous loop: **Discovery → Validation → Compliance → Governance.**

<small>### 📊 Metrics & Control Effectiveness</small>

<small>
| <small>Metric</small> | <small>Purpose</small> | <small>Target Outcome</small> |
|:--|:--|:--|
| <small>CMDB Accuracy (%)</small> | <small>Baseline alignment</small> | <small>≥ 95 %</small> |
| <small>Configuration Drift Rate</small> | <small>Unauthorized service frequency</small> | <small>Decrease over time</small> |
| <small>Time to Remediate</small> | <small>Closure speed for drift findings</small> | <small>Days not weeks</small> |
| <small>Exception Closure Rate</small> | <small>Resolved deviations</small> | <small>> 90 % within SLA</small> |
| <small>Audit Readiness Score</small> | <small>Current evidence coverage</small> | <small>100 % pre-audit</small> |
</small>

<small>### 💼 Business Risk Connection</small>  
<small>
Each technical finding maps to a business-level risk:  
• Unauthorized services → Operational Risk  
• Outdated services → Compliance Risk (ISO A.12 / NIS2 Art.21)  
• Missing CMDB entries → Asset Management Risk (A.8.1)  
All findings feed into the risk register and treatment plan — ensuring governance visibility and control effectiveness tracking.
